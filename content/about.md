## Hello, I'm Asher Carneiro 👋
Hey there! 👋 I'm all about Linux, Web Development, and Python. 💻 I started coding early on, and it's been my passion ever since. Currently diving into Go Lang 🚀 and scratching the surface of Machine Learning 🤖. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and always ready to tackle fresh tech challenges! 🌟

## My Goals
Looking forward, I'm pumped to keep leveling up in software development by diving into new tech and taking on cool projects. Always hungry to learn 📚 and stoked to make waves 🌊 in the ever-evolving tech world! 💻

## My Favourite Books Right Now
I'm into a mix of books that really grab my attention. 📚 Whether it's diving deep into "Theory of Everything," 🌌 enjoying the wit of "As You Like It," 🎭 or getting lost in the chilling world of "1984," 📖 each one brings something unique to the table. I also love a good escape with books like "The Attack of the Jack-O'-Lanterns." 🎃 Books are my go-to for both deep thinking and just kicking back. 🌟

## My Favourite Movies
I enjoy a range of movies that make an impact. 🎬 From the cosmic journey of "Interstellar" 🌌 to the classic adventure of "Empire Strikes Back" 🚀 and the quirky charm of "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" 🎸. I also love the excitement of "Baby Driver" 🚗, the heart in "The Intern" 👴, and the suspense of "A Quiet Place" 🤫. Movies are my escape into different worlds and emotions.
